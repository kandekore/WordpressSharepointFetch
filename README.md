A plugin that fetches content from a Sharepoint site and enables the user to add it to WordPress using a shortcode, a workaround for displaying Word Documents as HTML within WordPress pages, but can potentially any kind of document can be imported.

- The Motivation for building this application was I needed a method to display content from complex word documents, keeping index links and images.
- The application was built to provide a method of importing content to WordPress sites from SharePoint
- It solves the problem of having to rebuild documents to display on a website, it also presents an oportunity for end users to use SharePoint as a content managment system.
